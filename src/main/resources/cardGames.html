            <h3>Concentration/Memory</h3>
            <p> Age: 3+
            <p/>
            <p> Number of players: 2+
            <p/>
            <p> Cards: Standard deck of 52 cards
            <p/>
            <p> How to play: Older children can use the whole deck of 52 cards, but younger children may want to use
                fewer cards. Make sure the deck you use is made up of pairs.
                Shuffle and spread cards face down on a table between the players. Cards can be laid in a random pattern
                or in a grid. The object of the game is to find matching pairs. Players take turns turning over two
                cards and letting all the players see them and study them. If they are not a matching pair, try to
                remember what and where they are, then turn them back over. The next player turns over two cards. If
                they are a matching pair, that player removes them from the table and keeps them, and then has another
                turn. When all cards have been removed from the table, each player counts up the number of cards they
                have collected. The player with the most cards wins.

            <h3>Slapjack</h3>
            <p>Age: 4+
            <p/>
            <p>Number of players: 2-5
            <p/>
            <p>Cards: Standard deck of 52 cards
            <p/>
            <p>How to play: Choose a “dealer” to deal the cards face down to each player. Players cannot look at their
                cards, but instead put them into piles. Some players may have more cards than others, which is okay. The
                player to the left of the dealer begins by turning the card on the top of his pile face up in the centre
                of the table. The game continues with each player adding a card to the face up pile. When a jack is
                turned, players try to be the first to “slap” their hand over the face up pile. Whoever slaps their hand
                on the face up pile first gets the entire stack of cards and adds it to the bottom of their pile. The
                player to their left starts a new face up pile and play continues. If a player has no more cards, they
                have one more chance to stay in the game by slapping the next jack that appears. If they miss this
                opportunity, they are out of the game for good. The last person in the game is the winner.</p>
